# RandomEuclideanGraphs.jl
Personal codes to perform simulation on random optimization problems. For the moment the main capability is to compute the probability that a given point matches its k-th best partner in the optimal configuration for two euclidean random optimization problems: the matching and the assignment. This can be done in any dimension.
