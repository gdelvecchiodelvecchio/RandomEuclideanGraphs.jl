# RandomEuclideanGraphs.jl
The repository is always work in progress. Its aim is to provide useful functions to study typical properties of random euclidean graphs. For the moment the main capability is to compute the probability that a given point matches its k-th best partner in the optimal configuration for two euclidean random optimization problems: the matching and the assignment. This can be done in any dimension.
